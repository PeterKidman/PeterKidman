- Hi, I’m @PeterKidman
- I am living in Germany, I'm 65 years old and this is my first time to be on an online-community like this.   
- I always thought, "GitHub" had something to do with music - so much about my knowledge of english! 
- I'm currently learning VBA and Powershell and I'm excited to be here on GitHub ...
